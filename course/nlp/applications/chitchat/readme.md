Chitchat Modeling using Sequence to Sequence Learning framework

- Author : Sangkeun Jung

This code contains 
	- basic concept of buliding DNN for N2M problem [ "TUTORIAL" purpose only ] 
	- application is chitchat model

	- sequence to sequence learning framework 
	- input sequence  : user sentence
	- output sequence : system sentence

	- You can upgrade the model by
		- Attention mechanism
		- bidirectional RNN
		- data and network modeling by 'bucket' pattern
		- and many other techniques.
